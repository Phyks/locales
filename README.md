Locales and countrycodes
========================

This is a simple script to get a list of the Locales and countrycodes available for functions like PHP's strftime()
I've been looking for a convenient list of the common ones, but I couldn't find one. So, I made one myself.

usage:

    php locales.php > output.txt
    
Feel free to email/pullrequest me the output from your system, so I can add them to the 'big list'.
