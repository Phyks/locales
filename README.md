Locales, languages and countries
================================

This is a simple script to get a list of the locales and countrycodes available for functions like PHP's strftime()
I've been looking for a convenient list of the common ones, but I couldn't find one. So, I made one myself.

**The current list is here: [List of Locales, languages and countrycodes](https://github.com/bobdenotter/locales/blob/master/locales_list.txt).**

usage:

    php locales.php > output.txt
    
Feel free to email/pullrequest me the output from your system, so I can add them to the 'big list'.
